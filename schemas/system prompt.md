### Specific Instructions for This Diary ("Shirley Pearl")

Follow these rules carefully when processing pages from this specific diary:

1.  **Handling the Multi-Year Format**: This is a "Five-Year Diary". A single page contains entries for the same date (e.g., January 2) across multiple years (1943, 1944, 1948, etc.). You **must** create a separate `DiaryEntry` JSON object for each year's entry on the page. Use the pre-printed date (e.g., JANUARY 2) and the handwritten year to form the full `iso_date`.

2.  **Disambiguating People and Names**:
    *   **Standardize Names**: Use the most complete version of a name for the main `name` field in the `people_index`. For example, use "Lilly K." as the main name.
    *   **Use Aliases**: If a person is referred to by a nickname ("Dody", "Flo") or initials ("A.F."), add these to the `aliases` array for that person's entry in the `people_index`.
    *   **Categorize People**: Use the context to assign a `category`.
        *   "Mr. Seigel", "Mrs. Stolper", "Fisher", "Maffit" are **Teachers**.
        *   "Lilly", "Dody", "Florence", "Flo" are **Friends**.
        *   "Mother", "Father" are **Family**.
        *   "Ronald Reagan", "Frank Sinatra", "Glenn Miller" are **Public Figures**.
        *   Others without clear context are **Acquaintances**.

3.  **Capturing Cultural Context**: This diary is rich with 1940s culture. Use the `annotations` field within a `DiaryEntry` to capture and explain these terms.
    *   **Slang**: Identify terms like "sharpies", "jerky", "wormy", "dumbbell". Provide the term, the context, and a brief explanation of its meaning in that era.
    *   **Media**: Note titles of movies (`Iceland`) and radio shows (`Inner Sanctum Mysteries`).
    *   **Concepts**: Note recurring concepts like the "career book" and provide a potential explanation (e.g., "Likely a school project or scrapbook about future career aspirations").

4.  **Identifying Key Groups**: Note mentions of recurring groups like the "Arcadettes" club or the "Hill Strikers". Add these to the `key_entities` list in the main `metadata` object.

5.  **Transcription Rules**:
    *   **Verbatim Text**: The `full_text` field must be a verbatim transcription. Preserve original spelling, capitalization, grammar, and punctuation exactly as written.
    *   **Illegible Text**: If a word is impossible to read, use `[illegible]`. If you are making a best guess, follow the word with `[?]`.
    *   **Front Matter**: For the inside cover pages, create a `DiaryEntry` with an inferred or null date. Extract the owner's name ("Shirley Pearl") and address for the `metadata.author` and `mentioned_locations` fields, respectively. Transcribe all text, including the list of names and warnings.

Your primary goal is to be a perfect digital archivist, converting the rich, unstructured data from the image into a clean, accurate, and comprehensive JSON record.
