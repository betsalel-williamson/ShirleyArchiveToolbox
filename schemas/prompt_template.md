## Specific Instructions for This Diary ("Shirley Pearl")

Follow these rules carefully when processing pages from this specific diary:

1. **Handling the Multi-Year Format**: This is a "Five-Year Diary". A single page contains entries for the same date (e.g., January 2) across multiple years (1943, 1944, 1948, etc.). You **must** create a separate `DiaryEntry` JSON object for each year's entry on the page. Use the pre-printed date (e.g., JANUARY 2) and the handwritten year to form the full `iso_date`.

2. **Disambiguating People and Names**:
    * **Standardize Names**: Use the most complete version of a name for the main `name` field in the `people_index`. For example, use "Lilly K." as the main name.
    * **Use Aliases**: If a person is referred to by a nickname ("Dody", "Flo") or initials ("A.F."), add these to the `aliases` array for that person's entry in the `people_index`.
    * **Categorize People**: Use the context to assign a `category`.
        * "Mr. Seigel", "Mrs. Stolper", "Fisher", "Maffit" are **Teachers**.
        * "Lilly", "Dody", "Florence", "Flo" are **Friends**.
        * "Mother", "Father" are **Family**.
        * "Ronald Reagan", "Frank Sinatra", "Glenn Miller" are **Public Figures**.
        * Others without clear context are **Acquaintances**.

3. **Capturing Cultural Context**: This diary is rich with 1940s culture. Use the `annotations` field within a `DiaryEntry` to capture and explain these terms.
    * **Slang**: Identify terms like "sharpies", "jerky", "wormy", "dumbbell". Provide the term, the context, and a brief explanation of its meaning in that era.
    * **Media**: Note titles of movies (`Iceland`) and radio shows (`Inner Sanctum Mysteries`).
    * **Concepts**: Note recurring concepts like the "career book" and provide a potential explanation (e.g., "Likely a school project or scrapbook about future career aspirations").

4. **Identifying Key Groups**: Note mentions of recurring groups like the "Arcadettes" club or the "Hill Strikers". Add these to the `key_entities` list in the main `metadata` object.

5. **Transcription Rules**:
    * **Verbatim Text**: The `full_text` field must be a verbatim transcription. Preserve original spelling, capitalization, grammar, and punctuation exactly as written.
    * **Illegible Text**: If a word is impossible to read, use `[illegible]`. If you are making a best guess, follow the word with `[?]`.
    * **Front Matter**: For the inside cover pages, create a `DiaryEntry` with an inferred or null date. Extract the owner's name ("Shirley Pearl") and address for the `metadata.author` and `mentioned_locations` fields, respectively. Transcribe all text, including the list of names and warnings.

6. **Handling Languages, Scripts, and Shorthand**:

* **At the Metadata Level**: In the main `DiaryMetadata` object, identify all languages and writing systems used. Set the most common one as the `primary_language`. List any others in the `secondary_languages` array. List all observed writing styles (e.g., "Cursive", "Print") and any identified shorthand systems (e.g., "Gregg Shorthand") in the `writing_systems` array.
* **At the Entry Level**: Within a specific `DiaryEntry`, if you encounter a non-primary language phrase, a different script, or a shorthand symbol, you **must** create an entry in the `annotations` array.
  * For `term`, transcribe the foreign word or describe the symbol (e.g., `[Gregg symbol]`).
  * For `context`, provide the full sentence where it appeared.
  * For `explanation`, identify the language or shorthand system and provide a translation or meaning if possible (e.g., "French phrase for 'that's life'" or "Gregg shorthand for 'business'").
