Of course. Establishing a robust and repeatable front-end pipeline is just as critical as the LLM processing itself. A poorly scanned or processed image will lead to poor transcription, regardless of how good the prompt is.

Here is a structured, phase-by-phase process for scanning and pre-processing the diary pages. This process is designed to create a high-quality, consistent set of input images for your Step 1 LLM.

---

### **Pre-LLM Workflow: Digitization and Image Preparation**

This workflow transforms the physical diary into a set of clean, cropped, and normalized digital images ready for transcription.

**Goal:** Produce one high-quality image file per diary page, with a consistent naming convention.

---

### **Phase 0: Preparation and Documentation**

Before you scan a single page, set up your workspace and documentation.

1.  **Create a Digital Manifest:**
    *   Create a spreadsheet (e.g., `diary_manifest.csv`) to track the physical and digital objects.
    *   **Columns:** `journal_id`, `physical_description`, `condition_notes`, `scan_operator`, `scan_date`.
    *   **Example Row:** `SP-D1-1943`, `"Brown leather Five Year Diary, 1943-1944"`, `"Minor water damage on back cover, spine is fragile"`, `"J. Doe"`, `"2024-05-21"`
    *   This provides critical provenance for your digital archive.

2.  **Prepare the Scanning Environment:**
    *   **Scanner:** Use a high-quality **flatbed scanner**. Do **not** use a sheet-fed scanner, as it will damage the fragile book and produce distorted images. An overhead book scanner is ideal but expensive; a flatbed is excellent.
    *   **Surface:** Clean the scanner glass thoroughly with a lint-free cloth.
    *   **Handling:** Wear cotton or nitrile gloves to avoid transferring oils to the pages. Handle the diary gently, especially at the spine.

---

### **Phase 1: Image Capture (Scanning)**

This phase focuses on creating the initial high-quality "Archival Master" scans.

1.  **Scanner Settings (CRITICAL):**
    *   **Resolution:** **600 DPI** (Dots Per Inch). This provides excellent detail for OCR and preserves the image for future use. 300 DPI is an absolute minimum.
    *   **Color Mode:** **24-bit Color (or 48-bit if available)**. **NEVER** scan in grayscale or black & white. Information is contained in the color of the ink, the yellowing of the paper, and stains.
    *   **File Format:** **TIFF (`.tif`)**. This is a lossless archival format. PNG is an acceptable lossless alternative. **AVOID JPEG (`.jpg`)** for master files, as its compression creates artifacts that degrade the image.
    *   **Disable All "Auto" Enhancements:** Turn **OFF** the scanner software's automatic color correction, sharpening, deskewing, and cropping. You want the rawest possible image from the scanner; corrections will be done consistently in the next phase.

2.  **Scanning Process:**
    *   Place the diary open on the flatbed, capturing a two-page spread in a single scan.
    *   If possible, place a piece of black cardstock behind the page you are scanning to prevent text from the reverse side showing through.
    *   Apply gentle, even pressure on the book cover to flatten the pages against the glass as much as possible without damaging the spine.
    *   Scan each two-page spread sequentially, from the front cover to the back cover.

3.  **File Naming Convention (for Raw Scans):**
    *   Establish a strict, script-friendly naming convention.
    *   **Format:** `{JournalID}_scan_{SequenceNumber}_raw.tif`
    *   **Example:**
        *   `SP-D1-1943_scan_000_raw.tif` (The cover)
        *   `SP-D1-1943_scan_001_raw.tif` (The first two-page spread)
        *   `SP-D1-1943_scan_002_raw.tif` (The next spread)

---

### **Phase 2: Automated Pre-processing and Page Segmentation (Cropping)**

This is where you process the raw scans into usable page images. This entire phase should be automated with a script (e.g., using Python with libraries like `OpenCV` and `scikit-image`) to ensure consistency.

**Input:** A folder of `_raw.tif` files.
**Output:** A folder of clean, cropped, single-page `_p{PageNumber}.png` files.

Here is the sequence of operations within the script for **each raw scan image**:

1.  **Deskew (Straighten):**
    *   The scanned book may be slightly rotated.
    *   Use an algorithm (e.g., Radon transform or projection profile method) to detect the angle of the text lines and rotate the entire image so the text is perfectly horizontal.

2.  **Color/Contrast Normalization:**
    *   Correct for inconsistent lighting or scanner variations.
    *   Apply a white balance algorithm or a contrast stretching technique (like CLAHE - Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) to make the paper background appear more uniform and the ink stand out clearly.

3.  **Page Segmentation (The Cropping Logic):**
    *   This is the core of separating the left and right pages.
    *   **Method:**
        a. **Find the Gutter:** Analyze the image's vertical projection profile. The dark, ink-less area in the center of the book (the "gutter") will correspond to a minimum value in the profile. This identifies the dividing line between the left and right pages.
        b. **Identify Page Boundaries:** For each half (left and right), find the outer content boundaries. This can be done by looking for the first and last non-white columns and rows.
        c. **Calculate Bounding Boxes:** Based on the gutter and content boundaries, calculate the precise coordinates for two rectangles, one for the left page and one for the right.
        d. **Apply a Margin:** Add a small pixel margin (e.g., 50 pixels) to the calculated bounding boxes to ensure you don't accidentally clip the edge of the text or any marginalia.

4.  **Crop and Save:**
    *   Use the two final bounding boxes to crop the *color-corrected, deskewed* master image into two separate images.
    *   **Save as PNG:** PNG is a lossless format that is more web- and tool-friendly than TIFF. These are your "Access Copies" for the LLM.
    *   **Final File Naming:** Save the cropped images with a new convention that identifies the specific page.
        *   **Format:** `{JournalID}_p{PageNumber}.png`
        *   **Example:** The script processes `SP-D1-1943_scan_001_raw.tif` and produces:
            *   `SP-D1-1943_p001.png` (left page)
            *   `SP-D1-1943_p002.png` (right page)

READY FOR LLM INGESTION (Step 1 Prompt)
```

By following this structured process, you solve the bounding box issue you identified. The coordinates generated by the LLM in Step 1 will be relative to the clean, cropped, single-page image, which is exactly what you need for accurate data mapping.
