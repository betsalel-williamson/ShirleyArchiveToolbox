    # --- KERNEL EXPLANATION ---
    # The goal of this closing operation is to connect individual words on the same horizontal line
    # into a single solid blob, while AVOIDING the connection of separate vertical lines of text.
    # To achieve this, we use a rectangular kernel that is wider than it is tall.
    #
    # KERNEL_W (Width): Must be larger than the average gap between words to ensure they merge.
    # A value of 30 is chosen as a robust default to bridge these horizontal spaces.
    #
    # KERNEL_H (Height): Must be smaller than the average vertical gap between lines of text.
    # A value of 10 is chosen to be short enough that it doesn't accidentally merge a line
    # of text with the one directly above or below it.
    #
    # This anisotropic kernel matches the nature of written text (long horizontally, separated vertically).
    # --------------------------
    ap.add_argument(

    # --- EROSION KERNEL EXPLANATION ---
    # The primary goal of this erosion step is to eliminate any remaining thin-line artifacts
    # (like page edges or noise) that may have been connected to the main text block during the
    # previous closing operation.
    #
    # Unlike the rectangular closing kernel which was designed to be directional (anisotropic),
    # this erosion kernel is square (`EROSION_K` x `EROSION_K`). This is because its purpose is
    # isotropic (uniform in all directions) â€“ it's a test for 'thickness' regardless of orientation.
    #
    # The erosion operation works by sliding the kernel over the image. A pixel will only survive
    # (remain white) if the entire square kernel fits completely inside the white region around it.
    #
    # Therefore, a value of 12 for `EROSION_K` means we are removing any and all features that are
    # less than 12 pixels thick in any direction. This effectively erases thin horizontal, vertical,
    # and diagonal lines, while preserving the 'cores' of the chunky text blobs.
